		<h1>Hi, I'm Ryan.</h1>
		<p>I'd like to think I'm much better experienced in 3D, but who knows. Here's my story:</p>
		<p>I was born and raised in San Jose, CA and graduated from UCLA in 2011 with a BA in Economics. Shortly thereafter, I moved to San Francisco to work in investment banking at <a href="http://www.sagentadvisors.com/">Sagent Advisors</a>, where I focused on M&A in Technology and Healthcare and honed skills in financial modeling, project management, business strategy and market research.</p>
		<p>While finance was intellectually stimulating and engaging, I wanted to pursue a career where I could put my creativity to use and build tangible products. I am now a student in the Product & Design track at <a href="http://startupinstitute.com/about">Startup Institute (NY)</a>, an 8-week immersive career accelerator. In addition to learning front-end web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery) and  design principles (user-centered design, navigation & flow, rapid ideation, typography), I am working with a cross-functional team to solve challenges faced by one of SINY's partner companies.</p>
		<p>I do love meeting new people and am definitely an enthusiast of picking brains. I'd be happy to grab a coffee if you're in NYC (rock paper scissors for who's buying). If not, you can <a href="mailto:rlee928@gmail.com">reach me via email</a> or admire from afar via the links below.</p>
