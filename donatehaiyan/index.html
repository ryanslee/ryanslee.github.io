			<h1>About Typhoon Haiyan:</h1>
			<img class="animation" alt="rbtop-animated (6)" src="http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rbtop-animated-6.gif?w=1200&h=800" width="480" height="auto" scale="2">
			<p>10,000 people are feared dead or missing after Typhoon Haiyan ripped across the central Philippines on Nov. 8. The storm’s massive surge is blamed for much of the destruction, particularly in Tacloban, the capital of the southern island province of Leyte.</p>
			<p>Haiyan, whose local name is Yolanda, is one of the most powerful typhoons on record to make landfall. It had sustained winds of 147 mph, creating waves 15 feet tall. The storm’s surge swept away small villages and displaced more than 660,000 people.</p>
			<p>The government's confirmed death toll was 1,774 early Tuesday, said Jose Lampe Cuisa Jr., the Philippine ambassador to the United States. The storm has injured 2,487 more.</p>
			<p>Another 14 people were reported to have died in Vietnam, where the storm made landfall after hitting the Philippines. Another four were missing and 81 hurt. In addition, there were at least five storm-related deaths in southern China, where heavy rains caused flooding, destroyed houses and damaged farmland.</p>
			<p>In the Phillipines, troops and aid organizations battled blocked roads to deliver help and search for survivors in the splintered wreckage of homes. Tomoo Hozumi, the Philippines representative of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, said food, shelter, clean water and basic sanitation were "in a severe shortage" early Tuesday.</p>
