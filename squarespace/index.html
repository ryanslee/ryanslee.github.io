					<p><strong>Why I'm interested in Squarespace</strong></p>
					<p>Your mission is to provide creative tools, for first-timers and experienced technologists alike, that power the future of the web.</p>
					<p>Similarly, my interest in product design is driven by a desire to empower and effectuate change in nonprofits through technology. Many of these organizations lack focus on their online (and mobile) presence, which eventually hurts their fundraising efforts, reach, and ability to execute on their mission statement. I would love to work on product design at a company that shares the common goal of harnessing the power of the web.</p>
					<p>In addition, everyone I have talked to at Squarespace seems to be genuinely happy. I strongly believe that exciting and intelligent work environments help employees create high-quality work and drive great products.</p>

					<p><strong>All the money I have left</strong></p>
					<p>Just kidding. The dollar represents my prior experience in finance.</p>
					<p>For two years, I worked at an investment bank in San Francisco working on M&amp;A, private capital raises and strategic advisory in Technology and Healthcare. During this time, I was able to close three sell-side transactions, and honed skills in financial analyses, project management, business strategy and industry research.</p>
					<p>While investment banking was challenging, I was not interested in a long-term career in finance. I always had a strong desire to design and build products, so I quit my job and moved out to New York to learn product design at Startup Institute.</p>

					<p><strong>Hello Squarespace!</strong></p>
					<p>My name is Ryan Lee and I graduated from UCLA in 2011 with a degree in Economics.</p>
					<p>Shortly after completing a two-year stint in finance, I enrolled into an accelerator in New York called Startup Institute. I was accepted to the Product &amp; Design track, where I sharpened skills in both UX/UI design (user flow, prototyping, wireframing and responsive design) and front-end web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery).</p>
					<p>In addition to completing projects within the program, I was able to work with two startups and help out in various capacities with design research, mockups, wireframes, brand strategy, and more.</p>

					<p><strong>I love building things</strong></p>
					<p>This keychain is indicative of my personality. Ever since childhood, I've loved creating things and often expressed this through outlets such as Legos, woodshop classes and cooking.</p>
					<p>During high school, I entertained the idea of attending architecture or culinary school. However, I was never able to mentally commit myself (and convince my parents to allow me) to pursue a more creative career.</p>
					<p>My obsession with building has included projects such as wall clocks, skateboard ramps &amp; rails, and cardboard racetracks the size of my house. I know that I can leverage my existing passion and proactive attitude to design and create useful technology products.</p>

					<p><strong>What I'm up to</strong></p>
					<p>I recently completed the program at Startup Institute, and am now expanding upon my skills in front-end development and UX design.</p>
					<p>Currently, I am working as a freelance designer on projects ranging from e-commerce sites to early-stage technology startups. In addition, I am working on personal projects and involving myself in the New York technology scene by attending various meetups and participating in hackathons.</p>
					<p>Outside of professional goals, I am learning Spanish, training for a triathlon, exploring new recipes and working towards an intermediate proficiency in Javascript.</p>

					<p><strong>Why I'm a strong candidate</strong></p>
					<p><strong class="strong-two">I design for the user.</strong> I always strive to take a human-centered approach to design, and build to integrate the needs of users with the possibilities of technology, while keeping in mind the requirements for business success. Great products need to be both useful and usable; not one or the other.</p>
					<p><strong class="strong-two">I get s#%t done.</strong> I am self-motivated and proactive; I anticipate work, not wait for it. I will tackle messy or complicated tasks. During investment banking, I worked late into the night organizing thousands of buyer contacts. It was not my job, but I knew it would help streamline our processes.</p>
					<p><strong class="strong-two">I don't settle for 'good'.</strong> I demand remarkable work from myself. Even in banking, I treated every spreadsheet, presentation, and client meeting with a goal of delivering something exceptional.</p>
					<p><strong class="strong-two">I learn fast.</strong> Admittedly, I am new to the design world. However, in three short months, I picked up multiple front-end languages, worked with two startups, and learned how to use various design tools. I am confident in my ability and work ethic to know that I will keep learning and improving every day.</p>
