					<p><strong>Hello Squarespace!</strong></p>
					<p>My name is Ryan and I graduated from UCLA in 2011 with a degree in Economics. Afterwards, I spent two years at an investment bank in San Francisco working on M&amp;A, private capital raises and strategic advisory in Technology.</p>
					<p>While investment banking was challenging, I was not interested in a long-term career in finance. I've always had a burning desire to design and build great products. Ever since childhood, I enjoyed creating things - often through outlets such as Legos, woodshop classes and cooking.</p>
					<p>I subsequently quit my job and applied to an accelerator in New York called Startup Institute. I was accepted to the Product &amp; Design track, where I learned UX/UI design and front-end web development skills.</p>

					<p><strong>What I'm up to.</strong></p>
					<p>I recently completed the program at Startup Institute, and am now further developing my skills in both front-end development and UX design.</p>
					<p>Currently, I am working as a freelance designer on projects ranging from e-commerce websites to early-stage technology startups. In addition, I am working on personal projects and involving myself in the New York Technology scene by attending various meetups and participating in hackathons.</p>
					<p>Outside of professional goals, I am currently learning Spanish, training for a triathlon, exploring new recipes and working towards intermediate proficiency in Javascript.</p>

					<p><strong>We have shared interests.</strong></p>
					<p>Squarespace's mission is to provide creative tools, for first-timers and experienced technologists alike, that power the future of the web.</p>
					<p>Similarly, my interest in product design is driven by a desire to empower and effectuate change in nonprofits through technology. Many of these organizations lack focus on their online (and mobile) presence, which eventually hurts their fundraising efforts, reach, and ability to execute on their mission statement. I would love to work on product design at a company that shares the common goal of harnessing the power of the web.</p>
					<p>In addition, everyone I have met at Squarespace has told me that the culture at the company is outstanding. I strongly believe that being a part of an exciting work environment helps employees create high-quality work, and drives great products.</p>

					<p><strong>I get s#%t done.</strong> I am self-motivated and proactive; I anticipate work, not wait for it. I will tackle messy or complicated tasks. At Sagent Advisors, I worked late at night organizing thousands of buyer contacts. It was not my job, but I knew it would help streamline our processes.</p>
					<p><strong>I design for the user.</strong> I take a human-centered approach to design and build to integrate the needs of users, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success. Great products need to be both useful and usable; not one or the other.</p>
					<p><strong>I don't settle for 'good'.</strong> I demand remarkable work from myself. Even in banking, I treated every spreadsheet, presentation, and client meeting with a goal of delivering something exceptional.</p>
					<p><strong>I learn fast.</strong> Admittedly, I am new to the design world. However, in three short months, I picked up multiple front-end languages, worked for two startups, and learned how to use various design tools. I am confident in my ability and work ethic to keep learning and improving every day.</p>
